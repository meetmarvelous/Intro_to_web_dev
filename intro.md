### Why Web Development?  

Web development is one of the best digital skills to start with because:  
1. **Creative and Practical:** You can design and build websites for yourself or others.  
2. **In-Demand:** Businesses, organizations, and individuals need websites.  
3. **Accessible:** Anyone can learn it with the *right guidance*.

### Categories of Web Development  

Web development is broadly divided into three categories:  

#### **Front-end Development**  
- Focuses on the visible part of a website that users interact with.  
- Involves layout, design, and user experience.  
- Technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  

#### **Back-end Development**  
- Handles behind-the-scenes operations like data processing and storage.  
- Works with servers, databases, and programming languages (**Python, PHP, Java, Node.js**).  

#### **Full-stack Development**  
- Combines both front-end and back-end development.  
- Full-stack developers handle the entire development process.  

Fullstack Developer - **Full-stack developers** are comfortable working with both the front and back ends. At The Odin Project, we focus on teaching you full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development. 



Each plays a critical role in building functional and visually appealing web applications.

3. **JavaScript**

- Back-end: **Node.js, Express.js, Python (Django, Flask), Ruby on Rails, PHP (Laravel), ASP.NET, Java (Spring)**  
- Databases: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite**  

#### **Essential Tools:**  
- **Code Editor** (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text for PC; Acode Editor for mobile).

### Explaining the Core Technologies  

#### **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
- The backbone of a webpage.  
- Structures content like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.  

#### **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
- Styles and designs a webpage.  
- Controls colors, fonts, layouts, and visual arrangements.  

#### **JavaScript**  
- Adds interactivity and functionality.  
- Powers dynamic features like dropdown menus, sliders, and animations.  

**Example:**  
When you type *"do a barrel roll"* into Google, JavaScript makes the entire page spin.

### HTML Basics  

#### **Page Structure:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **Explanation:**  
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Defines the document as HTML5.  
- `<html>`: Root element of an HTML page.  
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information (e.g., title).  
- `<title>`: Displays the page title in the browser tab.  
- `<body>`: Contains visible content (headings, paragraphs, images, etc.).  

#### **HTML Elements:**  
An HTML element consists of:  
- Start tag (`<h1>`)  
- Content (`My First Heading`)  
- End tag (`</h1>`)  

Example:  
```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
```

#### **Headings in HTML:**  
There are six levels of headings:  
```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<!-- And so on up to h6 -->
```

#### **Try It Yourself:**  
Use an online editor like [W3Schools Tryit Editor](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default) to experiment with HTML.
